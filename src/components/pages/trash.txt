			The environmental magnitudes given into this file are obtained from the values
			read by the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) on board the Mars Science
			Laboratory (MSL) rover on Mars. This file provides the environmental magnitudes at REMS
			location, so MSL rover influences those magnitudes (rover position,
			rover temperature, rover orientation, rover shade, dust depositions on the rover, etc.)

			REMS does not take measurements continuously and it takes measurements at different
			times from one day to another. This fact has influence on the variation of the values
			given in this file from one day to another .

			For different reasons (instrument maintenance, instrument calibration, instrument degradation, etc.), 
			some or all of the magnitudes in this file may not be available.
		
sol_desc_en
			The term sol is used to refer to the duration of a day on Mars. A sol is about 24 hours and 40 minutes. For Curiosity,
			sol 0 corresponds with its landing day on Mars.
		
temp_desc_en
				Mars is farther from the Sun than Earth, it makes that Mars is colder than our planet.
				Moreover, Martian�s atmosphere, which is extremely tenuous, does not retain the heat; 
				hence the difference between day and night's temperatures is more pronounced than in our planet.
			
pressure_desc_en
				Pressure is a measure of the total mass in a column of air above us. Because
				Martian�s atmosphere is extremely tenuous, pressure on Mars' surface is about
				160 times smaller than pressure on Earth. Average pressure on Martian surface 
				is about 700 Pascals (100000 Pascals on Earth) Curiosity is into Gale crater,
				which is about 5 kilometers (3 miles) depth. For this reason, pressure measured
				by REMS is usually higher than average pressure on the entire planet.
			
abs_humidity_desc_en
				Martian's atmosphere contains water vapor, and humidity measures the amount 
				of water vapor present in the air. REMS records the relative humidity, 
				which is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air compared 
				with the amount of water vapor the air can hold at the temperature it happens
				to be when you measure it. Water on Mars is also present as water ice, 
				for instance, at Mars poles. Until today, however, proof of liquid water 
				in present-day Mars remains elusive.
			
wind_desc_en
				NASA Viking landers and NASA Pathfinder rover showed that the average wind speed
				on their location was pretty weak: 1 to 4 meters/second (4 to 15 kilometers/hour - 
				2.5 to 9 miles/hour). However, during a dust storm, winds can reach 30 meters/second 
				(110 kilometers/hour - 68 miles/hour) or more.
			
gts_temp_desc_en
				Martian's atmosphere is extremely tenuous, about 160 times thinner than Earth's,
				so heat from the Sun can easily escape. It makes that there are big differences
				between ground temperature and air temperature. Imagine you were on the Martian equator 
				at noon, you would feel like summer at your feet, but winter in your head.
			
local_uv_irradiance_index_desc_en
				Local ultraviolet (UV) irradiance index is an indicator of the intensity of the ultraviolet
				radiation from the Sun at Curiosity location. UV radiation is a damaging agent for life. 
				On Earth, ozone layer prevents damaging ultraviolet light from reaching the surface, to 
				the benefit of both plants and animals. However, on Mars, due to the absence of ozone in the 
				atmosphere, ultraviolet radiation reaches the Martian surface.
			
atmo_opacity_desc_en
				Weather on Mars is more extreme than Earth's. Mars is cooler and with
				bigger differences between day and night temperatures. Moreover, 
				dust storms lash its surface. However, Mars' and Earth's climates have
				important similarities, such as the polar ice caps or seasonal changes.
				As on Earth, on Mars we can have sunny, cloudy or windy days, for example.  
			
season_desc_en
				A Martian year is divided in 12 months, as Earth's. However, Martian months are
				from 46 to 67 sols (Martian days) long. The longest one is the month 3 (67 sols),
				and the shortest one is the month 9 (46 sols) Martian months mark seasonal changes. 
				In the southern hemisphere (Curiosity rover location) the autumn starts in month 1; 
				the winter in month 4; the spring in month 7; and the summer in month 10.
			
sunrise_sunset_desc_en
				The duration of a Martian day (sol) is about 24 hours and 40 minutes. The duration
				of daylight varies along the Martian year, as on Earth.
